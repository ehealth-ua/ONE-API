## Purpose
This job is designed to publish updates to person records in the MPI to a Kafka topic for synchronization and event-driven processing. It addresses the need for real-time notification of changes in person data, ensuring consistency across systems and enabling downstream services to react to updates.

## Key points
- The job runs on a scheduled basis using Quantum scheduler to fetch and publish person updates.
- It queries the database for person updates and publishes events to Kafka with details like status, verification status, and death date.
- Dependencies include Kafka producer and the MPI database.
- Configurable parameters include the Kafka topic and schedule.
- Logs the publication of events for monitoring.

## Configuration
- [Person Updates Publisher Configuration](https://e-health-ua.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOCS/pages/17565614105)
